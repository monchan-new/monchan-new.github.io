                When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes his snowboard, you can find Leee in front of this comuputer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough turorials.

                You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, or The ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
